# Back to School Again

Back to school again, where's my coat and where's my pen  
Back to school again, and what did you put in my sandwiches  

He's gone to school Wee Hughie and sure he is onlyfour  
I saw the fright was in him when he left that door  
But he took a hand of Dinny and he took a hand of Dan  
And with Joe's old coat upon him, ach the poor wee man  
(Do the best you can)  

Well the teacher he did teach me with his teacher's rhythm stick  
Reading and writing and a-rhythm-atic  
But when it was all over, sure his final words for me  
You'll never get a job for you've got no degree  
(It's the university)  

Well I went to the University and studied Modern Art  
I picked up on Picasso and I learned to paint like mad  
But when I graduated sure the only job at hand  
Was painting a computer for a silicone man  
(What a silly man)  

Back I went to night school like a lot of silly mugs  
All infected by computery and binary and bugs  
I entrusted to a robot all the knowledge I had known  
But a dog ate the floppy disc and I was on my own  
(He thought it was a bone)  

Well the good old ten times tables sure I tried to sing once more  
I still recalled the melody but not a single word  
But at least I've got a job now and I shouldn't really fuss  
For I am the driver of the old school bus  
(I've really got it sussed)
