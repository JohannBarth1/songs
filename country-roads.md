# Country Roads

Almost Heaven, West Virginia  
Blue Ridge 🏔️, Shenandoah 🌊  
Life is old there, older than the 🌳  
Younger than the 🏔️, growin' like a 🌬️  

Country roads, take me 🏠  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia, 🏔️ mama  
Take me 🏠, country roads  

All my memories gather 'round her  
Miner's lady, stranger to blue 💧  
Dark and dusty, painted on the 🌌  
Misty taste of 🥃, teardrop in my 👁️  

Country roads, take me 🏠  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia, 🏔️ mama  
Take me 🏠, country roads  

I hear her voice in the mornin' hour, she calls me  
The 📻 reminds me of my home far away  
Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin'  
That I should've been 🏠 yesterday, yesterday  

Country roads, take me 🏠  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia, 🏔️ mama  
Take me 🏠, country roads  

Country roads, take me 🏠  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia, 🏔️ mama  
Take me 🏠, country roads  

Take me 🏠, (down) country roads
